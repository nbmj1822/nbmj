        Uzabl.com is a platform for people who want to give used items a second life! We like to believe that there are people who want to reuse, recycle stuff instead of buying new ones every time. 
<br/>
Our members believe in the power of sustainability, and reusing stuff that are still good for months or years to come.
<br/>
<strong>
Uzabl.com is not a place to sell fake, stolen, counterfeit, or illegal items as listed here.</strong>
<br/>
We motivate members to be ethical while using Uzabl.com – be honest, truthful about the items you are selling, price them fair, and communicate like you’d do with your neighbors.
<br/>
Let’s together make it a marketplace where sensible buyers and sellers meet and exchange items.
<br/>
Thanks for helping us build a responsible and great community.
