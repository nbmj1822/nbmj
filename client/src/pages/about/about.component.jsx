        <h4>INTRO</h4>
        <p style={{fontSize:"20px"}}>
      <strong>  Reuse. Repurpose. Recycle.</strong> We exist because we believe there’s always some life remaining in items that we don’t use anymore or even if they have seen better days!
<br/>
<strong>Uzabl</strong> is a community of people who believe in giving a second chance to their used stuff. Period!
<br/>
We’re a platform, like several others, that makes it simpler and quicker for you to buy, sell or donate something you’d not want to buy new for a much higher price! Yes, we are honest about it.
<br/>
Try Uzabl before you get a brand-new item - you’ll be surprised at how people are willing to give away their cherished items for a nominal price that can last for months or years to come. And who doesn’t love a great deal!
<br/>
<h4>What makes Uzabl different?</h4>
<br/>
We envision a community of people who love to buy or sell used stuff and contribute to the environment - in a sense that those items don’t die off unused, or we consume more and more! Yes, we are a marketplace, but what drives us is the idea of building a community of responsible consumers who believe in sustainability. 
<br/>
<strong>We are not different. We’re trying to make a difference.<br/>
Thanks for being a part of a sensible community!</strong>


<h5>Why Uzabl.com?</h5>

<h4>How You Can Make the most of Uzabl.com</h4>

Think of Uzabl as your Recycle Bin! Yes, we mean it. When you Recycle, you give them a new life, a second chance. 
<br/>
Of course, there’s always a monetary angle, but the best scenario is to use Uzabl.com as a platform to give a second chance to your used stuff - buying from people who care and selling to those who’ll appreciate it.
<br/>

<h4>Uzabl.com Etiquette</h4>

You are <strong>RITE!</strong>
<br/>
<strong>Respectful. Person of Integrity. Truthful. Equitable.</strong>
<br/>

These are the four pillars of our co-existence. We believe in and trust all our community members to respect each other when communicating via messages or meeting in-person to finalize the deal.
<br/>
You shall always post the full picture of the item, from its title and description to the price – honesty is the best policy! Think of it like giving away your most loved possession to someone who’ll appreciate it – you have to be true and summarize the pros and cons honestly so everyone benefits from the exchange.
<br/>
Your integrity is what will keep the essence of this platform intact while benefitting all the members. Be true about the defects, how it was used or if anything needs a fix. Afterall, you’d not want your buyer to feel bad just like you’d not like it yourself. 
<br/>
Truthfulness will build a strong community of second handers where everyone can fluourish without doubt and feeling cheated.
<br/>
Let’s be RITE. Always.
