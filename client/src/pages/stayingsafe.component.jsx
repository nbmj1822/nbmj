       <strong> We have ZERO Tolerance against imposters, scammers and fakes. We ban fraudulent users permanently. </strong>
Like any business dealings, there always is a chance of misrepresentation and fraudulent behavior from certain members whose sole intention is to make money, cheat, or pass time!
We do our best to protect our members from such acts by actively monitoring the usage, implementing stringent policies and applying technologies to keep them at bay! We also ask members to report fraudulent members, fake or stolen products and proactively contribute to making this community an ethical one.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Buyers</h3>

Always be vigilant and alert.
Be smart when finding and finalizing an item. Look up, search for information about the product online or ask a friend.
Be fair when negotiating the price. Sellers won’t respond if you make low ball offers. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Read the product description CAREFULLY. </strong> We can’t emphasize more on this. There are 90% chances that your experience will be good if you read the full product information carefully, compare it with other similar listings, and search for more information online, etc. You’ve got to be smart!
<br/><br/>
<strong>Communicate with seller.</strong> We’ve made it easier for you to contact the seller about the product condition, availability, pricing, etc. You just need to start a chat with them and they’ll happily answer. But we ask you to make serious enquiries only, as the sellers are sometimes overwhelmed by messages from non-serious buyers!
<br/><br/>
<strong>Meet locally, in public places.</strong>
After finalizing the deal over chat, we suggest you to ask the seller to meet in places like – subways stations, cafe, shopping mall, nearby police station, or a public library. This is to safeguard both parties from fraud.   If the seller agrees and wants you to meet at his home, sure you can go ahead but it’s your responsibility to trust and be safe. In case of emergency, call 911.
<br/><br/>
<h3>Sellers </h3>
<strong>Respond swiftly.</strong> If you want to sell your item quick, make sure to reply to genuine buyers quickly.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Meet at a public place to finalize the deal.</strong> If it’s a heavy item, you may want the buyer to pick it up from your place, so it’s your responsibility to stay vigilant and safe.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Get positive reviews. </strong>Buyers can rate their experience and also leave a review about you. Your communication, offer, product information, genuineness – all are part of buyer’s positive experience, hence, your rating. The more positive reviews you have, the better your contribution to the community. Remember, if you’re R.I.T.E (Respectful. Person of Integrity. Truthful. Equitable) you’ll be a valuable member and a great seller!
<br/><br/>
